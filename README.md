Dit is een kleine CMS in wording, om PHP te leren, voor het beheren van visuele blogs van users.




# Basic PHP Framework

## Installation
- composer install
- npm install
- save .env.example as .env
- enter your MySQL credentials in your .env file

## Database Migration
- go to your project folder
- type: php migrate.php -f -s (-f rewrites all tables, -s seeds the tables)

## What is it?
A 'tiny' PHP & MySQL framework to build any app or website you want.
Sure, Laravel or any other PHP framework is better and has more options, but this framework is more like a study project.
It's a MVC framework which you can extend to what ever you want. Just check the code and see what it can do for you...

Have fun!
